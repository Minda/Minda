## Hi there 👋

🔭 I’m currently working on boosting computational efficiency by parallelizing algorithms and developing an AI Agent for scientific reasoning.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Leetcode practice interviews and System Design interviews. You can book me [here](https://calendly.com/kittentech/mock?back=1&month=2025-05) for either. 

🤔 I’m looking for help with techniques/frameworks for optimizing state management and renders in React.

💬 Ask me about Front End Development, LLM Prompt Engineering, GPU Optimization.

⭐ Top skills
