My name is Minda Myers. I’m an AI engineer specializing in agentic LLM systems, human-centered AI, and optimization—with a strong background in UX and front-end web development. I have 10+ years of experience shipping production web applications. Take a look at my personal webpage for more information: [minda.github.io](https://minda.github.io).

- 🔭 I’m currently working on agentic LLM UX patterns, RAG-based learning tools, and customizing LLM models.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on interpretability / evals, human-centered AI products, and fast, well-designed AI interfaces.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with ambitious research-to-product projects (especially where great UX and rigorous AI engineering meet).
